# Cesium Lower Manhattan + CitiBike Demo

This demo showcases CesiumJS with:
- **Global OSM Buildings** and **World Terrain** from Cesium ion
- A **3D Tiled Dataset** of Lower Manhattan (Cesium ion asset #3806843)
- A **GeoJSON Footprint of Manhattan** used to clip OSM buildings (hidden from view)
- **CitiBike NYC live station data** (station info + real-time availability)

The map flies to Lower Manhattan and overlays live CitiBike stations as clickable bike icons.
